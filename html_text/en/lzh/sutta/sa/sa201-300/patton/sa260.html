<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, Venerable Śāriputra paid a visit to Venerable Ānanda. After they had exchanged greetings, he withdrew to sit at one side. Venerable Śāriputra then asked Venerable Ānanda, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you, sir, might have some time to answer it for me?”</p>
<p>Ānanda said, “Sir, you may ask your question. I’ll answer with what I know.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Śāriputra asked, “Ānanda, there’s the term ‘cessation.’ What is it that ceases? Who possesses this cessation?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Ānanda said, “Śāriputra, the five acquired aggregates created by past actions and wished for in the past are impermanent and subject to cessation. It’s cessation of those things that’s called ‘cessation.’ What are the five? The acquired aggregate of form created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’ In the same way, feeling … conception … volition … consciousness created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Śāriputra said, “Yes, yes! Ānanda, it’s as you say. These five acquired aggregates created by past actions and wished for in the past are impermanent and subject to cessation. It’s cessation of those things that’s called ‘cessation.’ What are the five? The acquired aggregate of form created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’ In the same way, feeling … conception … volition … consciousness created by past actions and wished for in the past is impermanent and subject to cessation. The cessation of that thing is called ‘cessation.’”</p>
